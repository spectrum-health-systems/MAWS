# ABOUT

This is detailed documentation about the MAWS sourcecode.

## Comments

Attempts have been made to make this sourcecode as human-readable as possible, but since other organizations may use MAWSC, it is heavily comment everything as well - sometimes even in places where it is very clear as to what the code does.
 
You will find three types of comments in this sourcecode:
 
* `///` XML comments used by Visual Studio
* `//` Additional information
* `/*` Narrative comments `*/`

 Please do not remove any of the sourcecode comments!
